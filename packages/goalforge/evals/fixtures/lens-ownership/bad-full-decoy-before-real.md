# fixture: bad-full-decoy-before-real
# known-bad for b1 (gate B N1) — a complete decoy table under an unrelated
# heading precedes a real table that lacks `depends-on-direction`. Kills the
# mutant that drops `seen &&` from extract_rows: without it the first `|` line
# anywhere arms the parser, the complete decoy is read, and scanning stops at
# its blank line (false GREEN).
